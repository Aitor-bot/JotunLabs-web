                <p className='about-us__title'>What is Ants Lab?</p>
                <p className='about-us__subtitle'>
                    Ants Lab was born out of our conviction that
                    WEB3 is and should be the future.
                    We want control of our money, that's why we use Phantom instead of
                    Binance, now we need an alternative to social media, where we can own our data. </p>

                <p className='about-us__subtitle'>
                    Makes sense, right? This is where we decided to create Ants Lab
                    and that our first big project had to be a social network.
                    Totally decentralized, without servers where our data is stored, analyzed and exploited.
                    We will use the Solana blockchain, due to its low transaction cost, speed and unparalleled scalability.</p>

                <p className='about-us__subtitle'>
                    The core team consists of three developers and one artist.
                    Our CTO is a computer engineer with experience in several
                    WEB2 startups and is currently a computer science professor.
                    We will work divided in two teams under the SCRUM methodology,
                    Dev Team 1 will be in charge of developing the NFTMarketCap project and will be led by our founder.
                    Dev Team 2 will be led by our CTO and will have a team formed
                    personally by him, they will be in charge of the social network.
                </p>

                <p className='about-us__subtitle'>
                    NFTMarketCap will merge with the social network to create an all in one application
                    and we will reorganize the groups. We will not stay alone in these two projects,
                    our goal is to be the top 1 in bringing DApps to the general public.
                    That's why we will organize Hackathons periodically, to find interesting
                    projects and increase our team. Job search engines, instant messaging applications, games...
                    We have very ambitious ideas and, luckily, also the means.
                </p>
